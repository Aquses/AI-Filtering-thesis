At 6:16am, State Troopers were called to the accident at mile 17 of the highway, along with Nikiski medics and Kenai Police. Trooper investigation showed 19-year-old Kiana Edgmon of Kenai was driving a 2001 Dodge truck south when she crossed the center line and over-corrected, causing the vehicle to slide into the ditch along the southbound lane of the Kenai Spur Highway. The truck rolled over pinning Edgmon under the truck.  Medics were able to lift the truck and extricate Edgmon. She was the only occupant of the vehicle. The crash is still under investigation.

The US Fed has not given any indication that it actually targets a 2% inflation rate. From January 2012 forward, the average annualized inflation rate has been just under 1.2%.

It supplies the amount of formaldehyde that is necessary so there will not be a political process with the Palestinians ...
