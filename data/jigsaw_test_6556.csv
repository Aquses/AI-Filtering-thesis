Unless someone calling for more voter turnout is a Republican, their call is suspect for this reason:
Democrats already win everything all the time. If they want to see higher turnout it is only because they want the satisfaction and moral high ground of being able to claim a high majority of all people. Currently they can claim only a high majority of those few idiots who bother to play the game.
For Dems, winning all the time is not enough, they want to win BIG. All the time.
Winning the state repetitively is becoming boring for them, they need a challenge and that challenge is to see if they can win more bigger longer uncut.

Since MFs dominate ETFs by a factor of ten to one, why not apply the fear to a much bigger share of the investing world?

And by talking about a bundle of bonds in an ETF fund that masks the bad ones with the good ones -- just to draw an analogy to mispriced MBS -- makes it more ridiculous, because the bond rating services were responsible for treating the overall tranche without looking at the components in the ratings given to them. Deliberate and malicious incompetence, since the providers took out insurance to cover the losses on the products they fobbed off to the MBS purchasers, who suffered real losses from the mis-rating and had no cover.
