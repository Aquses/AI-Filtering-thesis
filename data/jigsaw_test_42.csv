At the time Ordinatio Sacerdotolis was issued by St. JP2 in 1994, many members of the Holy People of God, including bishops and priests and theologians and lay men and women, were most definitely shouting from the roof tops their conviction that the Church could and should ordain women. In fact, those of us who remember that time well, know for certain that the reason JP2 wrote Ordinatio Sacerdotalis was to put an end to those opinions by papal decree. Further, the very reason the CDF issued this declaration two years later in 1996 was because JP2’s document had not put an end to the very strong view in the Church that women could be and should be ordained. 

Nothing could be more obvious that that the principle of infallible by virtue of universal consensus cannot be invoked to put down a lively, broadly discussed, Catholic opinion.

As just one example of many, the study's authors claim that the BLM's ""primary purpose is to conserve or manage the lands that host wildlife""... maybe they happen to manage lands that host wildlife, but not for the purpose of wildlife conservation. I just looked on the BLM site for what they do ( http://www.blm.gov/wo/st/en/prog/more.html ) and wildlife is barely mentioned.
