BTW, ETFO wants to remove the names of dead prime ministers from schools, but ETFO doesn't mind having its members oversee sexist, anti-gay, and anti-anything-but-Muslim prayers in their schools - in a language most members don't even understand, so they can't even be monitored????",0.0,0.1,0.0

What moral high ground do you think you hold over people who were born and raised here and this is their way of life. Its not the default response. Its the we get sick of people coming from the lower 48 saying hey I don't like this. No one forced you to live here. There is a large reason that Anchorage/Palmer isn't growing at the pace of KGB/Big Lake. People are sick of some idiot on some council trying to rule their way of life.
