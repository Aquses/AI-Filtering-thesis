-Second Law: The probability that a certain person be stupid is independent of any other characteristic of that person.
-Third (and Golden) Law: A stupid person is a person who causes losses to another person or to a group of persons while himself deriving no gain and even possibly incurring losses.
-Fourth Law: Non-stupid people always underestimate the damaging power of stupid individuals. In particular non-stupid people constantly forget that at -all times and places and under any circumstances to deal and/or associate with stupid people always turns out to be a costly mistake.
-Fifth Law: A stupid person is the most dangerous type of person.

The retail price of natural gas had been capped by the FDR Administration during the Depression, and hadn't been deregulated.  Since oil producers couldn't make money on nat gas at that price, they just burned it off at the wellheads.  This led to a severe shortage in nat gas, so in the early 1970's, the price was deregulated.  As the price rose, more oil producers started capturing it and selling it into the market.  By 1983, the supply caught up with the demand, the price began to fall, and consumers didn't buy our projections any more, and stopped buying solar.  (cont'd)",0.0,0.0,0.0
